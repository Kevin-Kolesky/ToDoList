# ToDoList

Project Description: Building a Todo List Application

Objective:

Your task is to create a simple todo list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should allow users to add, edit, and delete todo items. Additionally, the application should store todo items locally so that they persist even after the page is refreshed.

Requirements:

1. Add Functionality: Users should be able to add new todo items by typing them into an input field and clicking an "Add" button.

2. Edit Functionality: Users should be able to edit existing todo items inline by clicking on them, editing the text, and pressing Enter or clicking outside the input field.

3. Delete Functionality: Users should be able to delete todo items by clicking a "Delete" button next to each item.

4. Local Storage: The application should use browser local storage to save todo items, so they are retained even after the page is refreshed.

5. User Interface: Implement a clean and intuitive user interface for the todo list. You can use simple styling to make it visually appealing.

Instructions:

1. Implement the required functionality using JavaScript.

2. Test your application thoroughly to ensure that all features work as expected.
